I'm Annie, a junior studying Information Science & Data Science at Cornell University. In my summers I worked at Amazon Web Service on their Natural Language Processing and gaming tools. On campus, I co-lead Cornell Design & Tech Initiative, where we build products for community impact!

I grew up fascinated by other people's stories. I thought deeply about their problems and how to solve them. I carried empathy to hackathons, where I found technology to be a powerful way to bring my thoughts to life. Now, I hope to be a storyteller and use technology to uplift voices of others, whether I'm considering the ethical impacts of products or leading educational workshops.

I learn best by doing and dabbled in designing, coding, writing, and business growth. Hit me up for a chat, I'd love to talk!
